# Opinions

## On TypeScript
TypeScript is excellent for building robust CLI tools. The type system catches many errors
at compile time. See [[ProjectAlpha]] for a practical example.

## On Agent Memory
Structured memory is crucial for agent performance. [[MEMORY]] and [[SOUL]] files
form the backbone of consistent behavior. Regular [[self-review]] helps maintain accuracy.

## On Collaboration
Working with [[Alice]] and [[Bob]] demonstrates the value of clear communication channels.
