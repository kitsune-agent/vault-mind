# Orphan File

This file exists but nothing links to it and it links to nothing.
It's completely isolated in the vault. No wikilinks here at all.
This is a quality problem because knowledge should be connected.
Not having any connections means this information is essentially lost.
The agent will never naturally navigate to this file through its link graph.
This represents wasted storage and potential confusion. A healthy vault
should have most files connected to at least one other file through wikilinks.
